/* The Karl transcript builder: turning one reviewed mockup page into a
   field-by-field instruction an editor follows in Karl's own form order.

   Pure. It takes a page object, a review record and the page corpus, and
   returns data — no filesystem, no DOM, no global state — so the Node CLI
   (build_scripts/export-karl-transcript.js) and the browser panel
   (js/karl/karl-transcript-panel.js) share exactly one set of judgements about what
   an editor is told to type. Every such judgement lives here and only here.

   The four outcomes are kept distinct on purpose, because keeping them apart is
   what makes the transcript safe to follow:

     TYPE     — an authored value the editor types.
     CHOOSE   — a page-chooser reference. The editor picks a page and types
                nothing, because the destination page supplies the words.
     UNMAPPED — no documented Karl destination. Emitted loudly, never guessed.
     FLAG     — a value with a known problem to resolve before saving.

   Nothing here writes anywhere. A transcript is an export: it changes what an
   export contains, not what it authorizes, and a human performs every
   keystroke.

   Dual-exported (window.karlTranscript plus module.exports) like
   js/review/review-merge.js and js/standards/plain-language.js.

   Load-order dependency: reads window.karlBlocks, window.cardInheritance and
   window.utils in the browser branch, so js/main.js must list it after
   js/karl/karl-blocks.js, js/core/card-inheritance.js and js/core/utils.js. Under Node it
   require()s all three directly. */

// Resolved the way js/editing/inline-content-edit-data.js resolves its helpers:
// require() under Node, the window namespaces in the browser. Dual-export files
// in this repo take no imports, so this indirection is the idiom rather than a
// workaround — see that file's own note at its foot.
