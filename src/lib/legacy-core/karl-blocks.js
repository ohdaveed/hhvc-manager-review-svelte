/* The Karl CMS panel inventory: what an editor's form actually contains, per
   content type, in the order the form presents it.

   Transcribed by hand from docs/karl-export-field-map.md — the E1 record of
   each type's live add-page form — rather than parsed from it at runtime.
   Parsing was rejected because half the mapping lives in prose FOOTNOTES under
   those tables (a Callout has no title field; the cost description caps at 120
   characters; bullets fold into the Text block's rich text rather than becoming
   a block of their own), and a parser that reads only the tables loses exactly
   those and reports success. tests/karl-blocks.test.js parses the document
   instead, so drift goes red in CI without the runtime ever depending on the
   prose staying machine-readable.

   Every row of every per-type table is transcribed, including the rows whose
   Mockup source is "—". A panel with no mockup value is not a panel an editor
   can skip: `primary_agency` is required on seven of the eight types and this
   tool has no field for it (U6), so the transcript has to say so rather than
   leave a hole the editor discovers when Karl refuses to save.

   Dual-exported (window.karlBlocks plus module.exports) exactly like
   js/core/card-inheritance.js and js/review/review-merge.js: the browser panel and the Node
   CLI must share one inventory rather than two copies free to come to disagree
   about which field an editor is being sent to.

   Load-order dependency: none of its own — it imports nothing and reads no
   global. It must simply be evaluated before anything calls window.karlBlocks,
   which js/main.js guarantees by listing it ahead of js/karl/karl-transcript.js. */

/**
 * A panel's mockup source, as a tagged union rather than a dotted path.
 *
 * The field map's "Mockup source" column is a PREDICATE on six of the eight
 * types — `section` with `component: 'supporting'`, `component: 'services'`
 * sections, `section with cards[]` — and a dotted path only on Transaction's
 * scalars. A path resolver would therefore cover one type and leave the rest
 * silently empty, which is the failure this whole feature exists to prevent.
 *
 * - `{ kind: 'none' }` — the panel has no mockup source.
 * - `{ kind: 'path', path, altPaths? }` — a dotted page path. `altPaths` covers
 *   the one field the mockup spells two ways (`whatToKnow.thingsToKnow` and
 *   `whatToKnow.items` are the same Karl panel).
 * - `{ kind: 'sections', match, field?, nth?, inferred? }` — every section
 *   matching `match`; `field` narrows the emission to one field of it (Agency's
 *   `services_title` takes the matched section's `heading`), and `nth` picks a
 *   single match by index (Campaign's Spotlight 1 and Spotlight 2 are two
 *   independent fields, not one repeatable one).
 *
 * A panel may carry an ARRAY of sources, which are tried in order and all
 * emitted.
 *
 * `inferred: true` marks a mapping this repo derived rather than one the field
 * map documents. There is exactly one today — a plain Transaction body section
 * reaching `custom_section` — and the transcript prints it as inferred so an
 * editor verifies it rather than trusting it.

/* **The ESM export block, and why it has to exist alongside the other two.**
 *
 * This module publishes three ways, which looks like belt-and-braces and is
 * not. `window.karlBlocks` is how the browser's IIFE layers reach it;
 * `module.exports` is how `build_scripts/validate.js` and
 * `build_scripts/karl-vocabulary.js` `require()` it from Node; and these named
 * ESM exports are what `js/karl/karl-guide-registry.js` imports.
 *
 * That third one was missing, and the failure is worth recording because
 * nothing caught it. `bun run build` worked, because Vite's CommonJS plugin
 * synthesises named exports from `module.exports` at build time. `bun run test`
 * worked, because Bun's own CJS/ESM interop does the same. `bun run test:e2e`
 * worked, because it runs `bun run start` — the BUILT bundle. Only
 * `bun run dev`, which serves this file to the browser unbundled, actually
 * asked the module for an export named `PROMOTE_PANEL`, and got a SyntaxError
 * that killed the whole module graph on page load.
 *
 * So the dev server was broken while every gate stayed green. Keep all three
 * publishing forms in step: adding a name below without adding it here brings
 * the same failure back, in the same place, with the same silence.
