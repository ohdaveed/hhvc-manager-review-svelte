	editorNote:
		'Redesigned from the live Healthy housing and vector control topic preview and the empty "Get help with pests, mold, or trash" topic preview as a task-first HHVC Agency landing page. It uses the latter as the first service section rather than creating a duplicate topic with the same reporting paths. It preserves the live topic’s 311 entry point, core services, inspection-program route, fee path, resource collection, and Articles 1, 2, and 11 references, but organizes them by the visitor’s decision: report, rent, manage a building, then research. Lead safety, water service, noise, asbestos, and structural construction concerns remain outside HHVC / Article 11 scope and point to Citywide services rather than being duplicated here. CARD TITLES AND TEXT ON THIS PAGE ARE NOT AUTHORED — they are inherited. A Karl Services/Resources subsection entry is only "add an SF.gov page or External link": there is no label field and no description field, so each card renders the destination page\'s own Title and Description (confirmed in the Karl editor docs, and against the live Environmental Health Agency page, whose card text is verbatim each destination\'s summary). Every `title`/`text` pair below is therefore a COPY of the destination page, kept here so the mockup renders something, and editing one changes nothing in Karl. Keep them in sync with their destination pages; to change what a card says, change that page. External-link cards are the exception worth re-checking, since they have no SF.gov page to inherit from. Agency fields intentionally left empty in this mockup: Logo, Main image, Alert, Highlights, Quick links, Call to action, Meeting information, Spotlight 1, Spotlight 2, Divisions or subcommittees, People, Public records, Topics, Archive information. That list was previously missing Quick links, Call to action, Public records and Topics, which are real Agency fields — it is now checked against the field inventory in the Karl docs ("How an Agency page works"). Two of those empties are worth revisiting rather than defaulting: Agency allows up to 2 Spotlights and both are unused, and Highlights takes exactly 2 or 3 entries, each REQUIRING an image of at least 350x200 plus a screenreader label — which on this tool means more inline WebP data URIs, so it is a real cost rather than a free win.

It briefly carried the task-shaped title "Get help with pests in your building"; that was reverted because a Karl subsection entry is only a page or external-link picker with NO label or description field, so the card renders the DESTINATION page\'s title and Description. Title and text here are therefore copied from `verminResources` verbatim and must be kept in sync with it — changing them here changes nothing in Karl.
