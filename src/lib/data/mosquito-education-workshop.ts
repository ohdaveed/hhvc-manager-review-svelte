    'Campaign page mock. Maps conceptually to Karl\'s "Campaign" content type (see docs/wagtail-content-mapping.md). Spotlight, Additional-content Accordion sections, and Top facts now render as their own real-Karl-matching components (verified live against sf.gov/shop-dine-sf and sf.gov/1865-til-infinity) — remaining Campaign page-level fields with no mockup equivalent: Primary agency, Logo, Background header image, Color theme (no source image assets exist for this illustrative program). Workshop form: the CTA links OUT to a Fillout form, matching how SF.gov form pages behave — the page describes the service and hands off to the real form rather than embedding one. The URL is a REPLACE-ME sentinel: no Fillout form exists for this workshop yet. The embedded mock at forms/mosquito-workshop-request/ is retained as a design reference for what that form should capture, but nothing links to it and it has no intake backend. SME placeholder — production form URL, intake backend, capacity, service area, lead time, and standards crosswalk below are illustrative example content for mockup review; confirm actual values with HHVC before publication.
