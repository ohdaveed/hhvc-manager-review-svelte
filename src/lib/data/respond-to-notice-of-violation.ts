Each mockup step becomes one Section with a Section title and one Text block in Section specifics. Transaction carries no per-step cost, time or optional flag, and no per-step page link, so an outbound link is placed with the rich-text Link tool inside Section specifics. The workflow is supported by the Article 11 Interpretation Guide v1.0 and the Vegetation Overgrowth Notice. Do not add DBI permit, appeal, or abatement-order requirements here without HHVC and legal review; those processes belong to DBI and are not established for this HHVC flow.',
