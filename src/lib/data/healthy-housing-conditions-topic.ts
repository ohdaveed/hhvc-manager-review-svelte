		"New Topic-type page mock, verified against the real, currently-live sf.gov/topics--healthy-housing-conditions — a Topic page that sits exactly where HHVC's own program belongs in SF.gov's real information architecture, one level above where this mockup's Agency page (pestsTopic) sits. Field mapping confirmed against docs/wagtail-content-mapping.md's \"Verified against the real Karl 'Topic' add-page form\" section (2026-07-05) plus this live re-check (2026-08-12). Every card below targets a page this mockup already has — no invented pages. The live page's own 'Lead poisoning issues'/asbestos content has no equivalent anywhere in this mockup and sits outside HHVC's established Article 11 scope (CLAUDE.md's banned-terms list), so it is not reproduced; the second Services sub-group below (\"Look up records\") substitutes this mockup's own real lookup Transaction pages in its place. Mockup fields with no equivalent here, matching every other page type's own documented gaps: Primary agency, Set top-level?, Child topics, Timeline (no other Topic pages exist in this mockup to nest under or list as children).",
