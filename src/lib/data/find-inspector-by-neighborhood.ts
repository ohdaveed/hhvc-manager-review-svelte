Confirmed during design (docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-11-hhvc-page-gap-additions-design.md) that scopeInfo holds no inspector-lookup content; the alias exists only so an old shared link resolves to something. Modeled on findHotelRecords' explainer-plus-lookup-button shape. The lookup tool's actual entry point (URL or internal tool) is unconfirmed — the button below targets the inert \"#\" placeholder until HHVC confirms a real destination; do not invent a URL.",
