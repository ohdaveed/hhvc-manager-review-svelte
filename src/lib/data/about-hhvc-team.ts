		'New About-us-type page mock. Karl\'s "About us" content type (Title, Primary agency, Information, Resources — live-admin-confirmed field list, docs/wagtail-content-mapping.md) has no real, currently-live HHVC equivalent to model content on: HHVC is a program inside the Environmental Health branch, not its own department, and Environmental Health itself has no About-us page. Structure is verified live against sf.gov/departments--controllers-office--about (visible "About {name}" H1, no visible eyebrow or summary, plain Information sections, a Resources block with named sub-groups) — but unlike the Topic-page pass, this page\'s OWN content (team composition, program framing) is illustrative mockup content for review, not reused real copy. Job titles (Environmental Health Inspector / Environmental Health Technician) are real, already confirmed elsewhere in this mockup (pages/pay-healthy-housing-fee.js\'s reinspection-fee rates cite the same two titles). Team size and specific numbers are deliberately not invented here — only scope and role descriptions, which are safer to state without a source. Karl fields with no mockup equivalent: Primary agency (same gap as every other page type in this mockup).',
